# Chat with csv using llama2 and langchain

The Llama2 model is a part of the LLaMA (Language Model Archive) project proposed by a large group of researchers. It is a collection of foundation language models with a parameter range from 7 billion to 70 billion. These models have been fine-tuned specifically for chat applications. The LLaMA project aims to provide a wide variety of language models for various natural language processing tasks, including chatbots and conversational agents. By offering a range of models with different sizes and capabilities, LLaMA aims to facilitate research and development in the field of natural language processing.

Here we are using the 7B parameter model the model is avaiable in hugging face

you can use this link to download model of your choice

Here are using langchain to train the model for the csv we are providing to it,And we are using streamlit for user interfacing and interactions,Here we are also using CTransformers which are transformer which are used to train the model from the computation power of your cpu
